        "Every Sperm Is Sacred"

        There are Jews in the world there are Buddhists
        There are Hindus and Mormons, and then
        There are those that follow Mohammed, but
        I've never been one of them
        
        I'm a Roman Catholic
        And have been since before I was born
        And the one thing they say about Catholics is
        They'll take you as soon as you're warm
        
        You don't have to be a six-footer
        You don't have to have a great brain
        You don't have to have any clothes on you're
        A Catholic the moment Dad came
        
        Because every sperm is sacred
        Every sperm is great
        If a sperm is wasted
        God gets quite irate
        
        Every sperm is sacred
        Every sperm is great
        If a sperm is wasted
        God gets quite irate
        
        Let the heathen spill theirs
        On the dusty ground
        God shall make them pay for
        Each sperm that can't be found
        
        Every sperm is wanted
        Every sperm is good
        Every sperm is needed
        In your neighborhood
        
        Hindu, Taoist, Mormon
        Spill theirs just anywhere
        But God loves those who treat their
        Semen with more care
        
        Every sperm is sacred
        Every sperm is great
        If a sperm is wasted
        God get quite irate
        
        Every sperm is sacred
        Every sperm is good
        Every sperm is needed
        In your neighborhood
        
        Every sperm is useful
        Every sperm is fine
        God needs everybody's
        Mine and mine and mine
        
        Let the pagan spill theirs
        Over mountain, hill, and plain
        God shall strike them down for
        Each sperm that's spilt in vain
        
        Every sperm is sacred
        Every sperm is good
        Every sperm is needed
        In your neighborhood
        
        Every sperm is sacred
        Every sperm is great
        If a sperm is wasted
        God gets quite irate
